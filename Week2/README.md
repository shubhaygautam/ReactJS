# TodoList App

A simple, sleek, and efficient TodoList application built with React. This app allows users to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete. Tasks are stored in localStorage, so they persist even after the browser is closed. Additionally, the app provides sorting and filtering functionalities to manage tasks better.
